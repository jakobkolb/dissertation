\chapter{General Introduction}
This general introduction has to cover the following topics:
\section{Agent-Based Modeling}
Definitely.
\section{`World-Earth' Modeling}
Also has to be in there. But not sure w.r.t. to the framing and wording.
With reference to the Copan Core framework paper
\section{Heuristic Decision Making}
Definitely. With reference to the section in Finns review paper
\section{Adaptive Networks and Aggregation Methods?}
Not so sure. But I can still decide on that later.
