\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would not have been able to write this thesis without the support of many individuals and organizations.
I thank Prof. J\"{u}rgen Kurths for the continuous trust and support during the last four years and for hosting me at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). I also thank Jobst Heitzig for day-to-day supervision, for inspiring discussions, for plenty of freedom when I needed it and for guidance and holding me accountable when I wanted it.


I want to thank the Foundation of German Industries (SDW) for placing their trust in me in the early phase of this project. Their scholarship was so much more than just financial support.
I also want to thank the Princeton-Humboldt Cooperation and Collective Cognition Network (CoCCoN), and there within especially Pawel Romanczuk, for the opportunity to participate and providing the funds to repeatedly visit Princeton University.
I want to Winnie Poel for her continued support and the big parts of our shared reproductive labor that she took on especially during the final stages of writing this thesis.
And last but not least, I am grateful for my two wonderful daughters who came into my life during the work on this thesis and who never get tired of reminding me that there is plenty of life outside of research.
